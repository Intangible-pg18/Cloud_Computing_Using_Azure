* Cloud Computing-: Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centres available to many users over the Internet.
* Virtualization-: is the process of creating a software-based or virtual, version of something whether that be computing power, storage, networking, servers, or applications. And what makes virtualization feasible is something called a hypervisor. It's simply a piece of software that runs above the physical server or host. They essentially, pool the resources from the physical server and allocate them to your virtual environments.
* Type 1 hypervisor -: A Type 1 hypervisor runs directly on the host machine's physical hardware, and it's referred to as a bare-metal hypervisor; it doesn't have to load an underlying OS first. With direct access to the underlying hardware and no other software -- such as OSes and device drivers -- to contend with, Type 1 hypervisors are regarded as the most efficient. 
*  Type 2 hypervisor-: A Type 2 hypervisor is typically installed on top of an existing OS, and it's called a hosted hypervisor because it relies on the host machine's pre-existing OS to manage calls to CPU, memory, storage and network resources.
